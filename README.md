### Hi there, I'm Aditya Shewalkar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Flutter developer who's passionate about problem-solving and data structures and algorithms (DSA). Currently, I'm studying at [Your College Name] and in my free time, I love to work on coding challenges and expand my knowledge of computer science concepts.

ðŸ”­ Current Projects
Project 1: FlashChat
FlashChat is a messaging application built using Flutter that connects users with one another using Firebase as the backend service. Users can create a profile, search for other users, and send messages to one another in real-time. The app uses Firebase Authentication for user authentication, Firebase Cloud Firestore for real-time database storage. The project is currently ongoing and is being developed as a personal project.

Project 2: MedReminder
MedReminder is a mobile application built using Flutter that helps users manage their medication by providing reminders and notifications about medication timing and dosage. The app uses Firebase for the backend service to store and retrieve user medication data, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications. Users can create a profile, add medications, set up reminders for each medication, and receive push notifications reminding them to take their medication at the appropriate time.
